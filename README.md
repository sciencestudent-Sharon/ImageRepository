# Image Repository

**Version 1.0.0**

Description: Image repository using socket programming â€“ where different multiple clients can upload an image to their account folder following authentication using login verification as well as AES & RSA encryption and decryption methods.

Motivation: To supplement a job application. To combine concepts from a Fall 2020 course that I really enjoyed and wanted to practice more in.
